    summary:     'Test offer/answer with a single declined audio stream'
    description: |
        This test has two scenarios that offer a single declined audio
        stream:
        - The first scenario, uac-declined.xml, offers a declined
          audio stream with the INVITE request. The expected response
          is a 488.
        - The second scenario, uac-declined-delayed.xml, offers a declined
          audio stream in the ACK. This should cause the channel to
          be immediately hung up.

# Note: The second scenario is currently disabled. This is due
# to ASTERISK-24410. When that issue is resolved, this scenario
# should be enabled.
