    summary:     'Test for CURL write'
    description: |
        This test exercises the CURL function's write capabilities. It
        creates a small JSON file and hosts it on the Asterisk instance's
        static HTTP server. It then spawns a channel which uses the CURL
        function to cURL the hosted JSON file into the Asterisk spool/tmp
        directory. Finally, it verifies that the retrieved file contains
        the same information as the hosted file.
