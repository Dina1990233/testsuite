    skip: 'Skip while failures are debugged'
    description: |
        'This test runs two calls through a queue. The queue is configured to run
        a particular gosub when a member answers. For the first call, we
        ensure that the configured membergosub are executed. In the
        second call, we give overriding parameters to the Queue() application and
        ensure that those are run instead.'
